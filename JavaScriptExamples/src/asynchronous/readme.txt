Udemy Maxmilian Notes
    JavaScript is single threaded, hence can execute only 1 task at a time
    Non-blocking  Normally , when the javascript code runs and makes an http call , should the javascript code wait
        for the response of the http call to come back. instead of waiting if we make the http call as asynchronous then
        the javascript code is non-blocking and can continue on the next line in the code. This is non-blocking and is
        usually handled by the browser.
    JavaScript is single-threaded , but offloads longer-taking tasks eg. timers to the browser ( which uses multiple threads)
